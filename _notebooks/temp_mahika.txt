One of the basic steps of any data analysis is the representation of objects in a machine-understandable format. The title of a research paper is the first interaction between the authors and readers. Ideally, the title of the paper captures the precise research field to which the paper contributes. The titles are converted to vectors using the Word2Vec and Doc2Vec algorithms to be able to perform computations on them. The cosine similarity between fifty randomly sampled titles has been plotted. The slider indicates the threshold
